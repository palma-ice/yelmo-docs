Here important parameter choices pertinent to running

outline a specific parameter or set of related parameters.
The author of each section and the date last updated

## Basal friction ##

Yelmo includes the representation of several friction laws that all take the form:

$$
\tau_b = -\beta u_b
$$

where $\beta$ is composed of a coefficient $c_b$ and potentially another contribution that depends on $u_b$ too:

$$
\beta = c_b f(u_b)
$$

In Yelmo, the field $c_b$ is defined by the variable `c_bed` and has units of Pa. The term $f(u_b)$ is not output in the model, but it contributes with units of yr m$^{-1}$, so $\beta$ finally has units of Pa yr m$^{-1}$. When multiplied with $u_b$, we arrive at $\tau_b$ with units of Pa. 

Yelmo calculates $c_b$ (`c_bed`) internally as either:

$$
c_b = c_{\rm b,ref} * N_{\rm eff}
$$

or 

$$
c_b = {\rm tan}(c_{\rm b,ref}) * N_{\rm eff}
$$

This is controlled by the user option `ytill.is_angle`. If `ytill.is_angle=True`, then $c_{\rm b,ref}$ (variable `cb_ref` in the code) is considered as an angle and the latter formulation above is used, following e.g., Bueler and van Pelt (2015). If `ytill.is_angle=False`, then `cb_ref` is used as a scalar field directly. In both cases, this field represents the till or basal properties (roughness, etc.) that are rather independent from how the effective pressure $N_{\rm eff}$ (variable `N_eff`) may be defined. 

With the variables formulated as above, it is possible to consider `cb_ref` as a tunable field that can be adjusted to improve model performance on a given domain. This can be achieved, for example, by performing optimization via the `ice_optimization` module, which adjusts `cb_ref` as a function of the mismatch of the simulated ice thickness with a target field. Also, `cb_ref` can either be optimized as a scalar field itself, or as an angle that is input to ${\rm tan}(c_{\rm b,ref})$ above.

Another possibility is to tune `cb_ref` as a function of other model or boundary variables. The most common approach is to tune it as as function of the bedrock elevation relative to present-day sea level (e.g., Winkelmann et al., 2011). In Yelmo, this is controlled by the parameter choices in the `ytill` section, and in particular the parameter `ytill.scale=['none','lin','exp']`. When `ytill.scale='none'`, no scaling function is applied and then `cb_ref=ytill.cf_ref` everywhere. When `ytill.scale='lin'`, a linear scaling is applied so that `cb_ref` goes from `ytill.cf_min` to `ytill.cb_ref` for bedrock elevations between `ytill.z0` and `ytill.z1` (saturating otherwise). Finally, if `ytill.scale='exp'`, an exponential decay function is applied, such that `cb_ref=ytill.cf_ref` for `z_bed >= ytill.z1`, and decays following a curve that reaches ~30% of its value at `z_bed=ytill.z0`. Finally, all values are limited to a minimum value of `ytill.cf_min`. 


## Effective pressure ##

Effective pressure (`N_eff`, $N_{\rm eff}$) in Yelmo is currently only used in the basal friction formulation as shown above. It provides a mechanism to alter the basal friction as a function of the state of the ice sheet, which is separate from $c_{\rm b,ref}$ (`cb_ref`), which represents the properties of the bed beneath the ice sheet. The calculation of `N_eff` can be done with several methods:

```
yneff.method = [-1,0,1,2,3]
-1: Set N_eff external to Yelmo, do not modify it internally.
 0: Impose a constant value, N_eff = yneff.const
 1: Impose the overburden pressure, N_eff = rho_ice*g*H_ice
 2: Calculate N_eff following the Leguy formulation
 3: Calculate N_eff as till pressure following Bueler and van Pelt (2015). 
 ```

*Historical note*

 To impose an essentially two-valued effective pressure formulation, use:
 ```
 yneff.method=3 yneff.set_water=T yneff.delta=0.02
 ```
 This is analagous to the old method where one value of `c_b` was imposed for frozen regimes and another value for temperate regimes. By using `yneff.set_water=T`, the maximum value of water thickness is imposed everywhere the model is temperate. Thus, `N_eff` should take values either of `N_eff=N_0=rho_ice*g*H_ice` in frozen areas or `N_eff=N_0*yneff.delta` in temperate regimes.
