[comment]: <> (Description of the executable. Here you have to write the main purposes of the executable. It would be good to add also job references if they exist. Remember: for programming, the more complete, the better.)

This flavour is quite similar to YelmoX ISMIP6 but using NAHosMIP forcings.
