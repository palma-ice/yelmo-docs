## Thermodynamics equations 

### Ice column

Prognostic equation:

$$
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \frac{k}{\rho c} \frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial z^2} - u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} - w \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} + \frac{\Phi}{\rho c}
$$

Ice surface boundary condition:

$$
T(z=z_{\rm srf}) = {\rm min}(T_{\rm 2m},T_0)
$$

Ice base (temperate) boundary condition:

$$
T(z=z_{\rm bed}) = T_{\rm pmp}
$$

Ice base (frozen) boundary condition:

$$
k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} = k_r \frac{\partial T_r}{\partial z}
$$

Note, the following internal Yelmo variables are defined for convenience:

$$
Q_{\rm ice,b} = -k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}; \quad 
Q_{\rm rock} = -k_r \frac{\partial T_r}{\partial z}
$$

### Bedrock column

Prognostic equation:

$$
\frac{\partial T_r}{\partial t} = \frac{k_r}{\rho_r c_r} \frac{\partial^2 T_r}{\partial z^2}
$$

Bedrock surface boundary condition:

$$
T_r(z=z_{\rm bed}) = T(z=z_{\rm bed})
$$

Bedrock base boundary condition:

$$
\frac{\partial T_r}{\partial z} = -\frac{Q_{\rm geo}}{k_r}
$$

## Equilibrium bedrock 

In this case, the bedrock temperature profile is prescribed to the equilibrium linear temperature profile. The slope follows:

$$
\frac{\partial T_r}{\partial z} = -\frac{Q_{\rm geo}}{k_r}
$$

and the bedrock surface temperature is given by the ice temperature at its base:

$$
T_r(z=z_{\rm bed}) = T(z=z_{\rm bed})
$$

## Active bedrock 

Yelmo calculates the temperature in the lithosphere along with the ice temperature. This can be achieved by assuming equilibrium conditions in the bedrock, i.e., that the temperature profile in the bedrock is always linear with `T_lith_s = T_ice_b` and the slope equal to `dT/dz = -Q_geo / k_lith`. Or, the temperature equation can be solved in the lithosphere together with the temperature in the ice column. 

The parameter block `ytherm_lith` controls how the lithosphere is calculated with `ytherm_lith.method=['equil','active']` deciding the two cases above. 

### Density of the upper lithosphere 



### Heat capacity of the upper lithosphere 

In both SICOPOLIS and GRISLI, a value of `cp = 1000.0 [J kg-1 K-1]` is used (referenced in Rogozhina et al., 2012; Greve, 2005; Greve, 1997). This value is adopted in Yelmo as well. 

```
cp = 1000.0    ! [J kg-1 K-1] 
```

### Heat conductivity of the upper lithosphere

Note, Yelmo expects input parameter values in units of `[J a-1 m-1 K-1]`, while much literature uses `[W m-1 K-1]`. Given the number of seconds in a year `sec_year = 31536000.0`, `kt [W m-1 K-1] * sec_year = kt [J a-1 m-1 K-1]`.

Rogozhina et al. (2012) use `kt = 2 [W m-1 K-1]` for Greenland:

```
kt = 6.3e7     ! [J a-1 m-1 K-1]
```

This value is supported by Lösing et al. (2020), who perform a Bayesian inversion for GHF in Antarctica. Assuming exponentially decreasing heat production with depth, lower values of `kt` are supported (see Fig. 7b). In a study on the global thermal characteristics of the lithosphere, Cammarano and Guerri (2017) adopt an upper crust thermal conductivity of `kt = 2.5 [W m-1 K-1]`.

To do: This study is also potentially relevant:

They show ranges of on the order of `kt = 2-3 [W m-1 K-1] for the Canadian shield.

The above value of `kt = 2 [W m-1 K-1] = 6.3e7 [J a-1 m-1 K-1]` is adopted as the default thermal conductivity of the upper crust in Yelmo. For historical context, see other estimates below. 

From Greve (1997) and Greve (2005): 

```
kt = 9.46e7    ! [J a-1 m-1 K-1]
```

which is equivalent to `kt = 3 [W m-1 K-1]`. The source of this value is not known. 

From GRISLI: 

```
kt = 1.04e8    ! [J a-1 m-1 K-1]
``` 

which is equivalent to `kt = 3.3 [W m-1 K-1]`. The source of this value is not known.   



## How to read `yelmo_check_kill` output

The subroutine `yelmo_check_kill` is used to see if any instability is arising in the model. If so, then a restart file is written at that moment (the earlier in the instability, the better), and the model is stopped with diagnostic output to the log file. 

Note that `pc_eps` is the parameter that defines our target error tolerance in the time stepping of ice thickness evolution. At each time step, the diagnosed model error `pc_eta` is compared with `pc_eps`. If `pc_eta >> pc_eps`, this is interpreted as instability and the model is stopped.
