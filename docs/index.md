# Yelmo

![Yelmo, Gaudarrama Mountains](img/yelmo.jpg)

Welcome to **Yelmo**, an easy to use continental ice sheet model.
**Yelmo** is a 3D ice-sheet-shelf model solving
for the coupled dynamics and thermodynamics of the ice sheet system. Yelmo
can be used for idealized simulations, stand-alone ice sheet simulations
and fully coupled ice-sheet and climate simulations.

**Yelmo** has been designed to operate as a stand-alone model or to be easily plugged in as a module in another program. The key to its flexibility is that no variables are defined globally and parameters are defined according to the domain being modeled. In this way, all variables and calculations are store in an object that entirely represents the model domain.

The physics and design of **Yelmo** are described in the following article:

## General model structure - classes and usage

### yelmo\_class

The Yelmo class defines all data related to a model domain, such as Greenland or Antarctica. As seen below in the yelmo\_class defintion, the 'class' is simply a user-defined Fortran type that contains additional types representing various parameters, variables or sets of module variables.

```fortran
    type yelmo_class
        type(yelmo_param_class) :: par      ! General domain parameters
        type(ygrid_class)       :: grd      ! Grid definition
        type(ytopo_class)       :: tpo      ! Topography variables
        type(ydyn_class)        :: dyn      ! Dynamics variables
        type(ymat_class)        :: mat      ! Material variables
        type(ytherm_class)      :: thrm     ! Thermodynamics variables
        type(ybound_class)      :: bnd      ! Boundary variables to drive model
        type(ydata_class)       :: dta      ! Data variables for comparison
        type(yregions_class)    :: reg      ! Regionally aggregated variables
    end type

```

Likewise the module variables are defined in a similar way, e.g. ytopo\_class that defines variables and parameters associated with the topography:

```fortran
    type ytopo_class

        type(ytopo_param_class) :: par        ! Parameters
        type(ytopo_state_class) :: now        ! Variables

    end type
```

Submodules such as ytopo\_class include parameter definitions relevant to topography calculations, as well as all variables that define the state of the domain being modeled.

### Example model domain intialization

The below code snippet shows an example of how to initialize an instance of Yelmo
inside of a program, run the model forward in time and then terminate the instance.

```fortran
    ! === Initialize ice sheet model =====
    
    ! Initialize Yelmo objects (multiple yelmo objects can be initialized if needed)
    ! In this case `yelmo1` is the Yelmo object to initialize and `path_par` is the
    ! path to the parameter file to load for the configuration information. This
    ! command will also initialize the domain grid and load initial topographic
    ! variables.

    call yelmo_init(yelmo1,filename=path_par,grid_def="file",time=time_init)

    ! === Load initial boundary conditions for current time and yelmo state =====
    ! These variables can be loaded from a file, or passed from another
    ! component being simulated. Yelmo does not care about the source,
    ! it only needs all variables in the `bnd` class to be populated.
    ! ybound: z_bed, z_sl, H_sed, H_w, smb, T_srf, bmb_shlf, T_shlf, Q_geo

    yelmo1%bnd%z_bed    = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%z_sl     = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%H_sed    = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%H_w      = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%smb      = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%T_srf    = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%bmb_shlf = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%T_shlf   = [2D array]
    yelmo1%bnd%Q_geo    = [2D array]

    ! Print summary of initial boundary conditions  
    call yelmo_print_bound(yelmo1%bnd)


    ! Next, initialize the state variables (dyn,therm,mat)
    ! (in this case, initialize temps with robin method)

    call yelmo_init_state(yelmo1,time=time_init,thrm_method="robin")

    ! Run yelmo for eg 100.0 years with constant boundary conditions and topo
    ! to equilibrate thermodynamics and dynamics
    ! (impose a constant, small dt=1yr to reduce possibility for instabilities)

    call yelmo_update_equil(yelmo1,time,time_tot=100.0,topo_fixed=.FALSE.,dt=1.0)

    ! == YELMO INITIALIZATION COMPLETE ==
    ! Note: the above routines `yelmo_init_state` and `yelmo_update_equil`
    ! are optional, if the user prefers another way to initialize the state variables.

    ! == Start time looping and run the model ==

    ! Advance timesteps
    do n = 1, ntot

        ! Get current time
        time = time_init + n*dt

        ! Update the Yelmo ice sheet
        call yelmo_update(yelmo1,time)

        ! Here you may be updating `yelmo1%bnd` variables to drive the model transiently.

    end do

    ! == Finalize Yelmo instance ==
    call yelmo_end(yelmo1,time=time)

```

That's it!
