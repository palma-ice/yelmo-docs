This site is built by the Python package `mkdirs`.

To publish the site from the master branch, simply
run `mkdocs gh-deploy`. This will build the site and
copy the files to the `gh-pages` branch online. The
new site should be available for access thereafter. 

Note that the docs folder here should be maintained
manually in sync with the docs folder in the Yelmo 
repository.
